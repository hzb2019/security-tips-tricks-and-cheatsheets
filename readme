This repo serves as a set of notes for my own personal reference, collected during
my efforts to study introductory cybersecurity. This means the contents may be 
difficult to understand as they were not written intended to be used by others.

Lots of the content includes notes that are rephrased/paraphrased, or downloaded 
copies of the content found at tryhackme.com. I am currently a satisfied customer 
of their premium services. As far as I am aware, this content is publicly avilable, 
but I am willing to remove it upon request.
