Azure Key Vault:
  This key vault holds anything from API keys, certificates, passwords, cryptographic keys,
  and more. Individual vaults are created and managed by vault owners who have full access
  to those vaults. Auditing may be enabled to keep records of who accesses what and
  permissions assigned to allow users to access the vault (vault consumers).

Entra ID (formerly known as Azure AD):
  An Identity and Access Management (IAM) service. It has the information to determine
  whether or not a user has the proper access permissions for a resource. 

Azure Cloud Shell:
  A preconfigured Bash or PowerShell CLI for managing Azure resources.
