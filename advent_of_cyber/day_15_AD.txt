AD Architecture Building Blocks:
  Domains: Logical grouping of resources including users, computers, and services.
           Main organizational unit for administration and are identified by Domain
           Component and Domain Controller names. Contents of a domain are subject
           to the same rulesets.
  Organizational Units: Containers in a domain for organizing groups of objects
  Forest: A collection of one or more domains sharing schema, configs, and global catalogue
  Trust Relationships: These allow users in one domain to access resources in another
                       domain in the same forest according to the relationship configs

All the above building blocks create the Distinguished Name (DN) that an object belongs
to in AD. ex. DN=CN=Mayor Malware, OU=Management, DC=wareville, DC=thm

Core AD Components
  Domain Controllers: The servers that host AD services. Includes DB storage and handling
                      auth. Multiple DC's can exist within a domain for redundancy. Changes
                      to the entire AD instance will be replicated across all DC's.
  Global Catalog: GC is a searchable database containing a subset of info from all objects
                  in the directory, allowing users and services to locate objects in any 
                  domain in the forest.
  Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): AD uses this protocol to query and modify
                                                the directory, allowing for fast searching  
                                                and retrieving info about objects.
  Kerberos Authentication: Default auth protocol used by AD using tickets rather than pw's.

Group Policy: Allows admins to enforce policies across the domain. Can be applied to users
              and computers to enforce pw policies, software deployment, firewall configs

Group Policy Objects: GPO's hold the group policies, and can be linked to the entire domain,
                      an OU, or a site

_______________
PASSWORD POLICY

  Run gpmc.msc 
  Right click the intended domain, select "Create a GPO in this domain, and Link it here"
  Give it an appropriate name eg. Password Policy
  Right click the group policy -> Select "Edit"
  Navigate to Computer Configuration -> Policies -> Windows Settings -> Security Settings
  -> Account Policies -> Password Policy

____________________
GOLDEN TICKET ATTACK

  This attack exploits AD by forging a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT), allowing the attacker
  to impersonate any account on the AD.

  Requirements:
    Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the domain
    SID of the domain
    Username of an account to impersonate
    KRBTGT account password hash - note, cracked password not necessary

  Detections:
    Event ID 4768: Look for TGT requests for high-privilege accounts
    Event ID 4672: Logs when special privileges are assigned to a user

_____________
KERBEROASTING

  An attack in which the attacker requests service tickets for accounts with Service
  Principal Names (SPNs), extracts the tickets and password hashes, then cracks them
  offline to retrieve passwords. 

  Mitigation: Implementing secure password policies across the AD

_______________
PASS-THE-TICKET

  Steals Kerberos tickets from a compromised machine and uses them to authenticate
  as the user or service from which the ticket was stolen. 

  Detections:
    Event ID 4768: Monitor for suspicious logins, particularly locations or devices
    Event ID 4624: Successful login - check to see the tickets being used for auth

_______________
MALICIOUS GPO'S

  GPO's can be exploited by attackers to create persistent privileged accounts and 
  distribute and execute malware. 

  Mitigation: Regularly audit GPO's for changes, ensure strict modify permissions are setup

___________________
SKELETON KEY ATTACK

  Installation of a malware backdoor to login to any account using a master password
  (skeleton key). Original passwords for the accounts are unchanged, simply bypassed
  by authentication with the skeleton key.

INVESTIGATING AN AD BREACH

  Check Group Policies:
    Investigate GPO's:
      Get-GPO -All
    Investigate GPO with [NAME]:
      Get-GPOReport -Name [NAME] -ReportType HTML -Path [OUTFILE]
    Get GPO's and sort by modification times (check for recent unusual activity):
      Get-GPO -All | Where-Object { $_.ModificationTime } | Select-Object DisplayName, ModificationTime 
    
  Event Viewer:
    Useful ID's:
      4624 - User account successful login 
      4625 - User account failed login
      4672 - Special privileges assigned to user 
      4768 - Kerberos TGT was requested for a high-privilege account

  User Auditing:
    Check locked out accounts:
      Search-ADAccount -LockedOut | Select-Object Name, SamAccountName, LockedOut, LastLogonDate, DistinguishedName
    List all users and their groups:
      Get-ADUser -Filter * -Properties MemberOf | Select-Object Name, SamAccountName, @{Name="Groups";Expression={$_.MemberOf}}

  Check PowerShell history and logs:
    %APPDATA%\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt

    Event Viewer: 
    Application and Services Logs -> Microsoft -> Windows -> PowerShell -> Operational 
    Application and Service Logs -> Windows PowerShell
