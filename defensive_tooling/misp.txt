Minimal subset of Tags
  The following tags can be considered a must-have to provide a well-defined event for distribution:

  Traffic Light Protocol: Provides a colour schema to guide how intelligence can be shared.
  Confidence: Provides an indication as to whether or not the data being shared is of high quality and 
              has been vetted so that it can be trusted to be good for immediate usage.
  Origin: Describes the source of information and whether it was from automation or manual investigation.
  Permissible Actions Protocol: An advanced classification that indicates how the data can be used to 
                                search for compromises within the organisation.
