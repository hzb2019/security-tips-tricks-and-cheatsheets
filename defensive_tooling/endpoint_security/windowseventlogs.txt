EVENT VIEWER

  Per Wikipedia, "Event logs record events taking place in the execution of a system to provide 
  an audit trail that can be used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. 
  They are essential to understand the activities of complex systems, particularly in applications with 
  little user interaction (such as server applications)."

  Log files are stored in a proprietary binary format with the file extension .evt or .evtx 

  Log files with .evtx extension located at: C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs

  Categories of Windows Logs:
    System Logs:
      Records events associated with the Operating System segments. They may include information 
      about hardware changes, device drivers, system changes, and other activities related to the device.
    
    Security Logs: 
      Records events connected to logon and logoff activities on a device. The system's audit policy 
      specifies the events. The logs are an excellent source for analysts to investigate attempted or 
      successful unauthorized activity.

    Application Logs: 
      Records events related to applications installed on a system. The main pieces of information 
      include application errors, events, and warnings.

    Directory Service Events: 
      Active Directory changes and activities are recorded in these logs, mainly on domain controllers.

    File Replication Service Events: 
      Records events associated with Windows Servers during the sharing of Group Policies and logon 
      scripts to domain controllers, from where they may be accessed by the users through the client 
      servers.

    DNS Event Logs: 
      DNS servers use these logs to record domain events and to map out
    Custom Logs: 
      Events are logged by applications that require custom data storage. This allows applications 
      to control the log size or attach other parameters, such as ACLs, for security purposes.
