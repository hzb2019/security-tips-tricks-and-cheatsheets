EVENT VIEWER

  Per Wikipedia, "Event logs record events taking place in the execution of a system to provide 
  an audit trail that can be used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. 
  They are essential to understand the activities of complex systems, particularly in applications with 
  little user interaction (such as server applications)."

  Log files are stored in a proprietary binary format with the file extension .evt or .evtx 

  Log files with .evtx extension located at: C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs

  Categories of Windows Logs:
    System Logs:
      Records events associated with the Operating System segments. They may include information 
      about hardware changes, device drivers, system changes, and other activities related to the device.
    
    Security Logs: 
      Records events connected to logon and logoff activities on a device. The system's audit policy 
      specifies the events. The logs are an excellent source for analysts to investigate attempted or 
      successful unauthorized activity.

    Application Logs: 
      Records events related to applications installed on a system. The main pieces of information 
      include application errors, events, and warnings.

    Directory Service Events: 
      Active Directory changes and activities are recorded in these logs, mainly on domain controllers.

    File Replication Service Events: 
      Records events associated with Windows Servers during the sharing of Group Policies and logon 
      scripts to domain controllers, from where they may be accessed by the users through the client 
      servers.

    DNS Event Logs: 
      DNS servers use these logs to record domain events and to map out
    Custom Logs: 
      Events are logged by applications that require custom data storage. This allows applications 
      to control the log size or attach other parameters, such as ACLs, for security purposes.

  Event types:

    Error
    Warning
    Information
    Success Audit
    Failure Audit

  C:\>eventvwr.msc

  The Clear Log button in the Log Properties window is the only way to clear a log

  PowerShell logs at Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > PowerShell

  Filter using right panel "Create Custom View" or "Filter Current Log"

GET-WINEVENT

  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.diagnostics/get-winevent?view=powershell-5.1

  Microsoft definition:
    "gets events from event logs and event tracing log files on local and remote computers."

  The Get-WinEvent cmdlet replaces the Get-EventLog cmdlet.

  Tip: If you are ever working on a Windows evaluation virtual machine that is cut off from the 
  Internet eventually, it will shut down every hour. ;^) 

  Useful Options:
    -ListLog [STRING[]]
    -ListProvider [STRING[]]
    -LogName [STRING[] / *]
    -ProviderName [STRING[] / *]
    -Path [STRING[]]
    -FilterHashtable [STRING[]]
    -FilterXml [STRING[]]


  Filtering:
    Get-WinEvent [OPTIONS] | Where-Object { $_.[PROPERTY] -Match '[STRING]' }

    Hash Tables:
      Event viewer can be used to aid in building queries (general tab, Log Name/Source/Event ID/Level)

      Guidelines for defining a hash table are:
        Begin the hash table with an @ sign.
        Enclose the hash table in braces {}
        Enter one or more key-value pairs for the content of the hash table.
        Use an equal sign (=) to separate each key from its value.
        Line breaks can be used instead of semicolons

      Syntax: @{ <name> = <value>; [<name> = <value> ] ...}
      Example: 
        Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{
          LogName='Application' 
          ProviderName='WLMS' 
        }

XPATH QUERIES

  Windows Event Log supports a subset of XPath 1.0: https://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xpath-19991116/
  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wes/consuming-events#xpath-10-limitations
  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/ms256115(v=vs.100)

  XPath definition:
    The W3C created XPath, or XML Path Language in full, to provide a standard syntax and 
    semantics for addressing parts of an XML document and manipulating strings, numbers, and 
    booleans.

  Windows Event Log XPath queries should start with '*' or 'Event'

  Event Viewer > Details > XML View 
  Craft queries with format '*/[TAG]/[TAG]/.../[TAG][OPERATOR][VALUE]'
                        or  '*/[TAG]/[TAG]/.../[TAG][@[PROPERY][OPERATOR][VALUE]]
  
  Keyword 'and' can be used to combine queries

  Example queries:
    // The following query selects all events from the channel or log file where the severity level is less than or equal to 3 and the event occurred in the last 24 hour period. 
    XPath Query: *[System[(Level <= 3) and TimeCreated[timediff(@SystemTime) <= 86400000]]]

    Get-WinEvent -LogName Application -FilterXPath '*/System/EventID=100'

    Get-WinEvent -LogName Application -FilterXPath '*/System/EventID=101 and */System/Provider[@Name="WLMS"]'

    // EventData query
    Get-WinEvent -LogName Security -FilterXPath '*/EventData/Data[@Name="TargetUserName"]="System"'

    Get-WinEvent -LogName Application -FilterXPath '*/'
