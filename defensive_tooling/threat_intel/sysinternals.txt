  Sysmon

    https://tryhackme.com/room/sysmon

    Official definition:
      System Monitor (Sysmon) is a Windows system service and device driver that, 
      once installed on a system, remains resident across system reboots to monitor 
      and log system activity to the Windows event log. It provides detailed 
      information about process creations, network connections, and changes to file 
      creation time. By collecting the events it generates using Windows Event 
      Collection or SIEM agents and subsequently analyzing them, you can identify 
      malicious or anomalous activity and understand how intruders and malware operate 
      on your network.

  WinObj

    Official definition:
      WinObj is a 32-bit Windows NT program that uses the native 
      Windows NT API (provided by NTDLL.DLL) to access and display 
      information on the NT Object Manager's name space.

    Session 0 is the OS session and Session 1 is the User session
    There should be at least 2 csrss.exe processes, one for each session
    Session 1 is for the first user to login to the system

    C:\>winobj -accepteula

    Using WinObj to correlate Session WindowStation with Process Explorer csrss.exe values:
      Go to WinObj, then navigate to \ > Sessions > [Session #] > Windows > WindowStations
      The value contained here can then be correlated to the value found in Process Explorer
      for the User mode csrss.exe value. When selecting csrss.exe in Process Explorer, in 
      the window below the Process list window, "WindowStation" can be found at the bottom
      of the "Type" field, and the WindowStation value can be correlated back to the 
      WindowStation value for the specific Session number being investigated.
